Electrum is a mod that tries to be vanilla+ by adding a new consumable type called metal cards! you need to hold these 
in you consulmable area for a set amount of rounds in order to use them!
there is also a new 3rd multiplier called Amp! as simple as it can get.
This mod currently adds:
- Amp, the 3rd multiplier alongside chips and mult.
- 20 metal cards
- 20 jokers
- 5 blinds (all are showdown blinds)
- and some other misc stuff like tarots, enhancements etc.
