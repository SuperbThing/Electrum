Electrum is a mod that tries to be vanilla+ by mostly exploring mechanics that haven't been in vanilla yet but feel like it.
This mod adds a new consumable type called **Metal** cards! you need to hold these 
in you consulmable area for a set amount of rounds in order to use them!
there is also a new 3rd multiplier called **Amp** alongside chips and mult! as simple as it can get.
# Current Features
This mod currently adds:
- The **Amp** mechanic.
- 20 **metal** cards
- 20 **jokers**
- 5 **blinds** (all are **showdown blinds**)
- the **Blaze** (and blaze flush) poker hand, which is basically 5 face cards
- and some other misc stuff like tarots, enhancements etc.
